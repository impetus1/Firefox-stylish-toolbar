This navbar essentially requires one custom thing on your firefox browser-- allow custom css from the about:security setting. First copy the repo. Then simply click on the button in preferences(in the front), make sure the chrome folder (3rd folder from the top)and copy the userChrome.css from the chrome folder. If you get lost there is additional documentation in firefox-sweet-theme.
